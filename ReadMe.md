To get started, you will need a Python installation.
```
$ python --version
3.6.3
```
This tutorial **might** work with ```Python 2.7``` but ```Python 3.6``` or later is recommended.

If you do not have Python3 on your system, the easiest manner to get Python3 and Jupyter Notebook is by downloading it here [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

All of the files being used during this demo can be obtained via GitHub.
Clone or download the repository [https://github.com/LSU-Analytics/activate_2018.git](https://github.com/LSU-Analytics/activate_2018.git)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LSU-Analytics/activate_2018.git
```
Run this command to install the packages:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Certain OS / Python environments may require ```pip3``` to work correctly.

Or you can install the packages individually.
```
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install jupyter
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install nltk
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install requests
$ pip install scipy
$ pip install seaborn
```
